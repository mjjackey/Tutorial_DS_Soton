    "# Refresher: What is Hadoop?\n",
    "\n",
    "Apache Hadoop is an open-source software framework for distributing the processing of large amounts of data across multiple machines. It has an emphasis on fault-tolerant processing of data on large clusters. Hadoop has three important components:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hadoop Distributed File System** - A distributed file-system that stores data and facilitates the sharing of data between different machines in a Hadoop cluster (group of machines).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hadoop YARN** - A platform for managing the computing resources available to Hadoop, notably performing the task of scheduling jobs to run on other machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hadoop MapReduce** - Support for the MapReduce programming model for large-scale data processing\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these are already set up and (mostly) configured in the Virtual Machine, though this tutorial will walk you through starting and using these tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Firstly: Start a new terminal\n",
    "In addition to running Notebooks, Jupyter is also capable of running a terminal, an interactive text-based interface to the Virtual machine. On the main menu on the `Home` page, you can start a new terminal by clicking on `New` -> `Terminal`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be using this to run some of the commands necessary to configure Hadoop. "

    "## Hadoop Modes of Operation\n",
    "\n",
    "Hadoop has three main modes of operation:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Standalone Mode** - This is the default mode used by Hadoop. It's localised to the current machine, and doesn't use HDFS, instead reading files from the local filesystem. It's primarily used for debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pseudo-Distributed Mode** - This is where Hadoop uses a cluster consisting of only a single machine, with every Hadoop daemon (a type of program that sits there doing work in that background) running on that machine. This is mainly used for testing the Hadoop setup. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Fully-Distributed Mode** - This is where data and processing is split between multiple machines. This enables Hadoop to horizontally scale and leverage the resources of multiple machines. This is the main mode used by Hadoop in production.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we'll only be using Standalone and Pseudo-Distributed modes."

    "## MapReduce\n",
    "\n",
    "MapReduce is a programming model used by Hadoop to process large amounts of data in parallel. It accepts input data in the form of a set of key-value pairs <key1, value1>. It divides this set into individual chunks and assigns them as tasks to be processed on individual machines. It works in two phases: A Map phase and a Reduce phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Map phase takes these key-value pairs in the form <key1, value1> and maps (processes them) into other, intermediate key-value pairs <key2, value2>.\n",
    "\n",
    "These pairs are then sorted by their key, and passed into the Reduce phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Reduce phase takes these keys and produces a third (smaller) set of keys, combining the elements from the intermediate pairs that share a common key.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "**<key1, value1>** is *mapped* to **<key2, value2>** which is *reduced* to a smaller set of **<key3, value3>**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't worry if it's all a bit abstract - there'll be examples in the rest of the tutorial."

    "You might want to look at Mahout, and try and put the data here into a format like the one in the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWl6AIZIVps) which can be used to train a naive Bayes algorithm to classify the spam data.  Alternatively, you can try and find the [SpamAssassin dataset](http://csmining.org/index.php/spam-email-datasets-.html) and import that yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hadoop over multiple machines is difficult to configure.  You might try and look at systems which assist you to do this, such as Ambari or Cloudera, and try to do these yourself.  If you don't have multiple computers available, to practice, give the [Caochong](https://github.com/weiqingy/caochong) library a try which sets up Hadoop in Docker containers on a single computer."
